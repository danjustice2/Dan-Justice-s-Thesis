> Lise is an administrative assistant for the Daycare department and was trained as an administrative employee in Vejle municipality. She describes herself as a "link" and "translator" between the more academically or technically educated employees in the Administration Building and the more practically oriented daycare workers. She says that daycare workers require different considerations than those who "sit in front of a screen all day" in the Administration Building, as their work does not involve as much IT. All daycare workers have an iPad. Lise provides an example that installing a new app on their iPads may seem minor to IT professionals, but it can be confusing for daycare workers, especially since they work alone in their homes and do not have colleagues for support. In such cases, Lise represents the interests of daycare workers in the Administration Building.
>
>
>
> When the daycare workers received iPads, Lise ensured that they could access email and knew to contact the IT department for help instead of her. She is a member of the Daycare Digitalization Group but had not heard of the IT investment process before. Lise would be "concerned" and "sad" if she had to use a form to contact the IT department. She explains that she "knows Jonas" and is aware that he understands the extra context surrounding daycare and the additional considerations needed in that area, as he has visited some of the daycare workers. If she had to use a form, she believes that the “unspoken considerations“ that occur when contacting someone in the IT department personally would be lost. She would feel torn between writing down the unwritten details (which are difficult to articulate, as they involve social/educational differences that are culturally uncomfortable to discuss) and feeling like she is talking down to the IT department, or not including these details and risking that work is carried out without consideration of their specific context.
>
>
>
> When asked about possible solutions to the dilemma if a form absolutely had to be used, Lise suggested that there could be an option to indicate whether the case involves a target group like daycare workers who have difficulty with technological changes or not. A solution proposed by the interviewer, which she thought was good, was that one could potentially write a contact person in the IT department on the form, who they would like to be involved in the case.

> Interview 181: Emma
>
>
>
> Emma has been working in the municipality for 13 years and took over her current position six months ago. Her job is to implement new welfare technologies. People from around the organization submit applications for new welfare technologies they would like to have implemented. Emma assists them in qualifying their applications to increase their chances of approval. She also serves as a project manager for many of the new technologies being implemented. She suggests that it would be more efficient if their applicants could automatically involve IT in projects related to IT. Emma believes that merging the IT investment process with their application template could be a great opportunity.
>
>
>
> Emma notes that there is not much promotion for the IT investment process. She heard IT business architect Jonas mention it at a meeting, but she assumed it was for higher-level positions in the organization. She partly blames the name for this perception. Emma compares the IT investment process to Fredericia Municipality's counterpart, "Indkøbsguiden" (The Purchase Guide), and thinks that such a name could make the process more tangible, as it is needed at the grassroots level of the organization. It could be more clearly communicated that the IT investment process is not just bureaucracy, but a support service for those with the least IT knowledge, providing a portal to open contact with IT.
>
>
>
> Emma also emphasizes the importance of how the process is advertised. If people only hear about it once, they may forget about it when they need it. To communicate the process more effectively, it could be targeted to specific departments that deal more with IT investments than others.
>
>
>
> Emma finds the name "IT investment process" unattractive and reminiscent of something the finance department might need. She has never heard IT architects referred to as architects; to her, they are just IT, and she is not familiar with their individual functions.

> Interview 160: Claus
>
>
>
> Claus is a development manager at CSV, Center for Special Education, which assists citizens in education with unique needs, ranging from brain injuries to anxiety and other conditions covered by the Special Education Act. His primary contacts in the IT department are architects Jonas and Mathilde. Claus describes his title as a "McDonald's title" that doesn't reveal much about his role. He is responsible for the digitalization and modernization of CSV, the IT-didactic aspects, and some GDPR-related tasks.
>
>
>
> CSV has many data processing agreements due to the special needs of their students. Claus estimates that they have as many, if not more, data processing agreements than the rest of the school system in Vejle combined.
>
>
>
> Claus says they use the IT investment process frequently, approximately every other year. He finds it helpful because it connects them with the right people, such as an architect who oversees the case, ensuring it is remembered and acted upon. In the past, they would contact individual IT department members for network solutions, but now they use the IT investment process to benefit from the architects' broader understanding of how a new project might affect other IT areas.
>
>
>
> Using the IT investment process also provides a clear line of communication when working decentralized, as they do. It allows them to follow a case in the system and see which IT department members are involved and what they are doing. Claus appreciates the ability to intervene if he feels a need has been misunderstood.
>
>
>
> CSV began using the IT investment process after a recommendation from Jonas. Claus personally likes official processes and going through official channels, as it reduces risks, such as contacting an architect who might be sick.
>
>
>
> Claus describes their workplace as the communication hub for CSV as an organization. He appreciates that the IT investment process assigns a fixed contact person for the project, making it clear who to contact at central IT.
>
>
>
> However, Claus mentions that they also have some IT investments that are entirely outside central IT if they don't run on the municipality's network or require support from the municipality. In such cases, they naturally don't use the IT investment process.
>
>
>
> Claus sees the arrival of architects in the organization as a "godsend" that brought structure and allowed them to be contacted whenever needed. He describes some IT colleagues as less service-oriented but highly skilled in technical aspects, with architects acting as the vital link that ensures things get done.
>
>
>
> Claus's only dissatisfaction with the current system is the fear of data breaches that has led to restrictions, such as not being able to update programs on his computer without contacting central IT. He wishes there were more flexibility and risk-taking in this area, and that Søren from school IT and central IT could collaborate more closely, as these areas are now more interconnected than they used to be.
>
>
>
> Interview 183: Peter
>
>
>
> Peter has been a care assistant for 13 years, and although he recently retired, he still works at the residential care facility one day a week to help with their IT. He started his career as a typographer, which involved some technical work and was his first introduction to IT. As a care assistant, he had many IT-related tasks even though it was not part of his official job title.
>
>
>
> The residential care facility is a home for severely developmentally disabled adults with autism. Peter describes it as an area of the welfare system where employees are most vulnerable, as some residents can become violent. He mentions a young woman who showed potential to help with IT management but became pregnant— the facility does not allow pregnant women to work there due to the risks and previous incidents that resulted in harm to unborn children.
>
>
>
> The facility has 34 residents, 176 employees (divided into 7 groups), and 65 computers. While some administrative staff have their own computers, most employees share computers when they need to document their work. Peter emphasizes the importance of the computers always functioning, as problems can arise when they don't. In this situation, there are no full-time IT staff on-site, so care assistants with IT knowledge must step in to handle various IT tasks. Peter expresses concern about the facility's reliance on him or other IT-knowledgeable staff and worries that any gaps in support could ultimately impact the residents.
>
>
>
> Eventually, the facility decided that Peter would work one day a week with IT and be a care assistant the rest of the time. However, he says it has been impossible to stick to this arrangement as there are always pressing IT issues that need to be resolved immediately.
>
>
>
> Peter feels that his dual role as IT support has sometimes compromised the well-being of the residents. He believes that higher-ups in the organization do not fully understand the need for IT support and think they can "administer their way out of it." He disagrees with this approach.
>
>
>
> Peter describes a situation where a resident had a Wi-Fi router set up in their room to accommodate their specific needs. The resident accidentally destroyed the router, so a new one needed to be installed. Peter discussed this with IT architect Mathilde, who told him to submit a request to the IT service desk and she would handle it. However, Mathilde was attending a course that day, so the request was addressed by support staff who followed the rules to prevent network disorganization: the router was not to be set up on the resident's network, and the case was closed. Peter was aware of the IT investment process but couldn't use it due to organizational constraints: technically, he was not responsible for it, and another person, Lene, was.
>
>
>
> The fact that Peter has had to juggle IT tasks alongside his care assistant role has prevented the necessary dialogue between Vejle's IT department and decentralized IT staff. Peter shares some information about Lene: she works part-time at the residential care facility and another location. He explains that while she is excellent at organizing IT, she is not the hands-on IT support they need.
>
>
>
> Peter also mentions that the organization needs a new alarm system, which he was told would be implemented by mid-February. Management wants the system in place by March 22nd, even though central IT is not involved in the project. He considers this expectation to be highly unrealistic, saying, "it's not going to happen."
>
>
>
> When asked about the responsibility of maintaining the complex phone system, he says nobody knows who is in charge. The lack of a dedicated IT staff member is described as a cost-saving attempt, which Peter estimates will cost more in the long run.
>
>
>
> Peter wonders what will happen to the facility when he fully retires, as they will have to rely on support from Vejle's central IT department. However, this does not seem feasible considering the facility's location and the fact that they operate year-round, providing constant care to residents. Waiting for support from central IT, especially during weekends or holidays, is not a viable option.
>
>
>
> Lastly, Peter expresses a desire for more flexibility in hardware purchases, as they are required to buy phone models that become outdated within a few years. He claims that phones from their system supplier's recommended brand had a 6-year warranty, but his suggestion was dismissed as being biased towards the supplier's recommendations.
>
>
>
> Interview 163: Søren
>
>
>
> Søren is responsible for purchasing IT equipment ('isenkram') for schools. Schools can buy new items if there are existing agreements, but otherwise, they should go through him. He is also the GDPR coordinator for the schools, acting as the main contact for GDPR-related matters.
>
>
>
> Søren has been working in the municipality since 1986, starting as a schoolteacher before taking on the role of IT School Consultant at the administration building in 2005. He has experienced problems with people simply buying whatever they want, describing it as a bit of a "wild west" situation in some areas.
>
>
>
> In theory, schools should use the IT investment process, but in practice, this doesn't happen. Søren explains that part of the reason is that the process is on the municipality's intranet, VKIntra. For municipal employees, the intranet opens automatically when they log in. This does not happen for school employees, who must actively seek out the intranet and log in, creating an additional barrier.
>
>
>
> Instead of using the IT investment process, school employees typically contact their school's IT advisor, who then reaches out to Søren or IT business architect Mathilde directly. Søren believes it's realistic to get schools onboard with using the IT investment process, but it requires some "training." However, he says that "fortunately," there isn't often a need for it. He wonders if this in itself is a challenge, making it more difficult for people to adopt the process since it doesn't become ingrained in their daily routines.
>
>
>
> Currently, this training takes place through Mathilde holding three joint meetings per year with the IT advisors at schools. In this way, she explains to them what the IT investment process is about. Søren mentions that the IT department used to function like a "parallel society" that didn't communicate much with others. It is a recent development that they have reached out more to decentralized areas in an attempt to build better relationships. Like interviewee 189, he attributes this change to the relatively newly hired IT architects (within the last 5-10 years).
>
>
>
> Søren describes the earlier version of the IT investment process, before it was simplified, as having been created with a "municipal perspective" and not aimed so much at decentralized facilities. He believes it is important for there to be "room for innovation" in schools since teachers have different passions and thus different IT equipment needs.
>
>
>
> Interview 191: Anders
>
>
>
> Anders, like many others, was initially unsure if he had anything to contribute to the project. However, in the end, he provided valuable insights by discussing some IT investment projects and how the process looks in the real world from the perspective of someone not an insider in the IT department.
>
>
>
> The primary project we discussed was the Tourism Department's project of setting up an avatar – a chatbot connected to a physical system with a microphone and speech-to-text, a camera to see if anyone was present, a text-to-speech program and speakers for oral responses, and a screen with a face that citizens could talk to. The avatar was completed for the Tour de France in the summer of 2022. The project began in 2019 or 2020 but took a long time to complete due to the coronavirus pandemic.
>
>
>
> They got the idea for the avatar by attending an inspiration event/conference and meeting a company that developed such technology. They wanted to invest in it, as they saw it as cutting-edge technology. They contacted someone from the IT department, who then referred them to Brian Slot, the head of Digitalization & IT, as it sounded like something "not known in the municipality" at the time, and they wanted to invest in it. Around a meeting table, they agreed that Digitalization & IT would pay for half of the costs to develop the avatar, as well as practical details.
>
>
>
> During the project, there were some uncertainties, such as whether their internet connection was fast enough to support the technology at a location away from Vejle's administration building. Jonas was also involved in this aspect.
>
>
>
> It seems that many people from the IT department were involved in this project. One wonders if the IT investment process could have made everything run more smoothly?
>
>
>
> Anders was not familiar with the IT investment process beforehand. He says that during this process, the IT department did not mention the process.
>
>
>
> He comments that he has previously been a purchasing manager for a private company and points out that there is a difference in philosophy: in the private sector, people often talk about how long it takes for an investment to pay off. In the public sector, there is less focus on profit and more on providing the best possible service for citizens.
>
>
>
> We also discussed how municipalities seem to compete with each other, which we agreed seems to push the entire country forward.
>
>
>
> Interview 165: Karina
>
>
>
> Karina works as an IT system administrator and did not have much to say about IT investments, as her role does not involve decision-making on which systems are implemented. She was not familiar with the investment process and did not think it was important for her work. This reinforces the impression that one of the issues is the lack of clarity about who is responsible for ensuring that IT investments are reported.
>
>
>
> Karina is instructed by her superiors (project managers at the Digitalization Department/Digitalization Agency/other governmental units) on which systems to use, and her role involves setting up and administering those systems. When she needs to communicate with the IT department, she typically speaks with Heine, Alan, and Jesper (not the architects).
>
>
>
> She suggested that more questions be directed to the IT department regarding the justification for the IT investment process and whether there have been specific instances where problems have arisen.
>
>
>
> Interview 189: Freja
>
>
>
> Freja is a web manager in the Politics, Analysis & Communication department. Her primary responsibilities include managing the website and intranet, web accessibility, and various other tasks.
>
>
>
> With 20 years of experience in her position, Freja has never used the IT investment process and is very confident in her conviction. She is well aware of its existence but sees it as a waste of time since she works right above the IT department and says, "I know who I should talk to" if she needs anything from the IT department, as well as what they cannot help her with. In cases where the IT department couldn't assist, she has either done the tasks herself or outsourced them.
>
>
>
> Freja notes that the IT department previously lacked many competencies, but she now sees what she describes as a greater "maturity," with a broader range of skills acquired, both technically and relationally. However, she still perceives an IT department that can seem like they "think they know it all" even though they don't.
>
>
>
> She believes the process can become excessively bureaucratic and encourages the IT department to adopt a more communication- and relationship-based approach, focusing on "good relations" to create an environment that encourages employees to approach the IT department when they need help.
>
>
>
> Freja and the interviewer agreed that the IT department should instead take responsibility for maintaining a list of what they deal with, rather than requiring people to fill out a form.
>
>
>
> The conversation touched upon the issue of "double solutions." Freja thinks that people have become much more aware of not purchasing duplicate solutions and have improved at checking with the IT department when in doubt.
>
>
>
> She believes that the IT department should be better at using "carrots" rather than sticks. However, she can see the IT department's perspective in some situations where they might think, "Couldn't they have asked [before implementing a solution]?"
>
>
>
> Interview 176: Ida
>
>
>
> Ida had a unique perspective on the investment process, but it's difficult to see how it could fit into the research question and narrative being built. She is a GDPR lawyer who sits on Vejle's Information Security Council, which reviews the implementation of new technologies. She advises the Information Security Committee on GDPR compliance.
>
>
>
> Ida works at the Department of Technology & Environment, where, for example, employees may want to obtain new programs that have not yet been approved. Part of the process of approving a new solution or program involves sending it to her, where she reviews the app's privacy policy and provides feedback on whether, in her assessment, it meets GDPR requirements.
>
>
>
> She often experiences a kind of language barrier between her perspective on things and the technical side from the IT department, as different words can be understood differently in various fields of expertise. This can lead to instances where the IT department might think a solution should be fine in terms of GDPR, while she, as a lawyer, has to be more cautious and potentially say "no" to the proposed solution.
>
>
>
> Interview 169: Mikkel
>
>
>
> Mikkel works as a department head for the library's IT. He sits on the Digitalization Forum and is responsible for the library's systems, their operation and development, project management, and communication between stakeholders at the municipal and national level. As a central library, he also handles some tasks for other libraries and works with Region Syddanmark. He wears many hats in his role.
>
>
>
> Unlike other interviewees so far, Mikkel's library has actually utilized the IT investment process. He says it's not often they do this, but the last time was with some display screens. He found the process somewhat frustrating, as they had to fill in information they had already examined closely. However, he notes that the form has been simplified compared to before it was shortened.
>
>
>
> Mikkel describes the IT department as having been more "conservative" in the past with statements like "we are a Microsoft municipality," but he sees a similar development to other interviewees with the IT department becoming more "development-oriented" and fostering better collaboration. The architect Mathilde has the library as her specific area of responsibility. Before her, there was another person who only worked with the municipality for a short time. Mikkel describes Mathilde as a good collaborator and says that the library has started to think, "maybe we should reach out to Mathilde to ask about this," since she has been good at sharing knowledge and has been more involved than they have seen from the IT department in the past. The quarterly meetings with Mathilde, as described in earlier interviews, are helpful to Mikkel. He says he has already heard about many of the topics from other sources, such as the Digitalization Forum, but sometimes he brings other employees to the meetings so they can also hear the information.
>
>
>
> Mikkel explains that there have been disagreements or uncertainties about when the IT investment process actually needed to be used, as the requirements for using it are, on paper, extremely broad. He suggests that this discrepancy might affect people's willingness to use the process since the rules clearly do not align with reality.
>
>
>
> He acknowledges the importance of the IT investment process in avoiding double investments and security threats, but has sometimes struggled to reconcile the IT department's expectations with the national initiatives and systems that they are subject to as a central library. He has been told that some systems are not used in the municipality, but he says he doesn't care if they are not used in the municipality since they are organizationally separate. However, this creates dilemmas when, in practice, they use the municipality's network and are supported by the municipality's IT department.
>
>
>
> Mikkel also mentions that he has spoken with the IT architect Jonas.
>
>
>
> Interview 190: Anne
>
>
>
> Anne is a professional consultant for the Salary department and serves as the primary contact for KMD, the provider of the municipality's payroll system. When she needs assistance from the IT department, she usually calls IT architect Jonas. Her last personal IT investment was a digital voting system six months ago.
>
>
>
> For new systems that affect the payroll system, a form 32 must be filled out, which acts as a sort of management supervision assigning a data manager for the system. Anne is responsible for ensuring that form 32 is completed. Here, they face similar challenges as the IT department, with some employees reporting new systems later in the process than the Salary department would prefer.
>
>
>
> Anne was not aware of the IT investment process before the interview. In situations where the IT investment process could have been relevant, she thought, "I better just ask [the IT department]," even though she was not familiar with the official guidelines.
>
>
>
> She seems to share a similar attitude with the IT department, wishing that employees in the organization would be better at consulting with her before purchasing systems that fall within her area of responsibility, rather than buying the system first and then consulting with her about its implementation afterward. This attitude may be why she has a good relationship with the IT department, consulting with them well in advance.
>
>
>
> Anne recalls an instance when she was called to a meeting by someone in the organization, along with Jonas, thinking that she 'might' have a stake in the implementation of their new system. She described the meeting as, "It was a video meeting, but I could sense that Jonas and I were looking at each other on the screen, thinking 'is this really happening right now.'" This was because the third person had already purchased the system without asking and wanted it up and running in three weeks, which she found very unreasonable. She describes such situations as having sometimes been a tremendous workload. Thus, although Anne and Jonas work in different professional areas, they share some frustrations. A central frustration is that employees' expectations for the timeline of implementing new things do not match their own.
>
>
>
> Anne reacted positively to the idea of a central system that directs communication in different parts of the organization based on certain guidelines (e.g., inquiries about a new payroll system are forwarded to the Salary department and IT, after which the departments can forward the cases to the relevant members of their departments). She points out that there is a lack of cohesion in the organization, but it is also important to preserve the freedom to "think for oneself." Another essential factor is having more fixed and transparent guidelines for when reporting is necessary and to whom in the organization, so that employees with new investments in the pipeline do not have to guess who should be involved and when in the process they should be involved (before purchasing? After purchasing? Just when considering investing? When needed to be implemented in 3 weeks? 3 months? 3 years?).
>
>
>
> Another good point Anne made was how to make the IT investment process come to life. It must be communicated clearly in some way, but who exactly is the target audience? To which forum should it be communicated? How can one avoid communicating with the wrong people in the organization?
>
>
>
> Assistant: # OVERVIEW
>
> ## THINK
>
> Self 1: The interviews provided a lot of information about the IT investment process and the experiences of employees in various roles within the municipality. It seems that some are aware of the process, while others are not. There are also some interesting insights into the relationship between the IT department and the rest of the organization.
>
>
>
> Self 2: Yes, it seems that there are some common themes, like the lack of clarity about the IT investment process and its purpose. There's also a sense that the process may be too bureaucratic, and that better communication and relationships between the IT department and other departments could help improve compliance.
>
>
>
> Self 1: That's true. It's also interesting to see how different employees have different perspectives on the process, depending on their roles and experiences. Some see the process as helpful, while others find it frustrating or unnecessary.
>
>
>
> Self 2: Right. We should also consider the various suggestions for improving the process, like making it more accessible and user-friendly, and better promoting it within the organization. There's also the idea of having more fixed and transparent guidelines for when and how to report IT investments.
>
>
>
> Self 1: Absolutely. Another aspect to consider is the role of IT architects in the organization. Some employees seem to have a positive view of their involvement, while others are not as familiar with their roles or see them as less service-oriented.
>
>
>
> Self 2: That's a good point. We should also think about the various challenges and barriers that employees face when it comes to the IT investment process, like the need for training, the lack of access to the intranet for some employees, and the issues of double solutions and decentralized IT support.
>
>
>
> Self 1: Yes, all of these factors will be important to consider as we analyze the data and create our affinity diagram. We'll need to break down the interview notes into discrete segments, group them together, and label them in a way that helps us understand the main themes and issues at play.
>
>
>
> Self 2: Agreed. Let's start by brainstorming a list of data segments from the interview notes, and then we can move on to sorting and grouping them.

> # SORTING, GROUPING, AND LABELLING
>
> ## THINK
>
> Self 1: We have a good list of data segments now. Let's think about how we can group them together in a meaningful way to better understand the main themes and issues.
>
>
>
> Self 2: We could start by grouping the segments related to awareness and understanding of the IT investment process. This would include segments like lack of awareness, bureaucratic nature, and uncertainty about when to use the process.
>
>
>
> Self 1: That's a good idea. We could also group the segments related to communication and relationships between the IT department and other departments, as well as the role of IT architects in the organization.
>
>
>
> Self 2: Yes, that makes sense. Another group could be the challenges and barriers faced by employees when it comes to the IT investment process, which would include segments like the lack of training, inaccessibility of the intranet, and double solutions issue.
>
>
>
> Self 1: Great. We could also have a group for suggestions and improvements to the process, like making it more user-friendly, better promoting it, and having more fixed and transparent guidelines.
>
>
>
> Self 2: That's a good group. Lastly, we could have a group for the specific contexts and considerations of different departments or facilities, like decentralized IT support, residential care facilities, and schools.
>
>
>
> Self 1: I like that. Let's write down these groupings with appropriate names.

> ## THINK
>
> Self 1: Now
>
>
>
> Assistant: that we have our affinity diagram, let's think about what could be done better or what aspects we might have missed. Remember, this is qualitative research, so there's always room for improvement.
>
>
>
> Self 2: One area we could consider is whether we've captured all the relevant perspectives from the different roles within the municipality. We have a good range of interviewees, but there might be other individuals or roles that could provide additional insights.
>
>
>
> Self 1: That's true. We might also want to look at whether there are any underlying assumptions or biases in our data segmentation and grouping. For example, are we inadvertently privileging certain perspectives or experiences over others?
>
>
>
> Self 2: Good point. We should also consider the depth of our analysis. Are there any themes or issues that we could explore further, or any connections between the groups that we haven't yet identified?
>
>
>
> Self 1: Yes, that's an important aspect to consider. Additionally, we could think about the clarity and consistency of our groupings. Are the group labels clear and descriptive, and do they accurately capture the content of the segments they contain?
>
>
>
> Self 2: Definitely. And finally, we should consider the practical implications of our findings. How can the insights we've gained from this analysis be used to inform strategies for improving compliance with the IT investment process in Vejle municipality?
>
>
>
> Self 1: Great points. Let's keep all of these considerations in mind as we continue to refine our affinity diagram and analyze the data.
