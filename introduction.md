# Introduction

At the intersection of technology and human behaviour, in the microcosm of a municipality, an intriguing challenge unfolds. This study is anchored in Vejle Municipality, Denmark, where over 10,000 individuals work cohesively to serve a thriving community of 120,000 residents @vejlekommuneVejleKommuneRunder2022 @vejlekommuneVejleKommuneRunder2022. Within this socio-technical system, a fascinating case study unravels around a simple online webform - a tool designed to streamline IT investments, but which currently faces issues of compliance from the workforce. By delving into the intricacies of this challenge, this study seeks to unravel why, despite its apparent simplicity and functionality, the employees of Vejle Municipality aren't fully engaging with this tool. In doing so, the research hopes to inform strategies that will help increase compliance, streamline the IT investment process, and thus, enhance the overall efficiency within the municipality.

## The Vejle Municipality IT Department

The Vejle Municipality IT department operates within the administrative building and has historically faced challenges when it comes to effectively communicating with stakeholders outside of its immediate vicinity, particularly individuals in decentralised roles. Recognising the need to expand its reach and improve efficiency, the department has strategically hired four IT architects in recent years, each possessing unique strengths and expertise.

These IT architects play a crucial role in the municipality's IT ecosystem. Their primary responsibility revolves around aligning the expectations of municipal employees with the IT department's capabilities and resources, while considering the broader organisational context. Achieving this requires effective communication and a comprehensive understanding of both technical and non-technical perspectives from the various stakeholders within the municipality. It is a role that demands a combination of "soft" and "hard" skills, as the architects must empathise with the diverse needs and perspectives of users across the municipality, all while staying up-to-date with current and emerging technologies.

For the purpose of this study, two of these architects will be referred to as Jonas and Mathilde. They bring a compelling balance of perspectives to the table: Jonas excels in the technical intricacies of IT architecture, while Mathilde places a crucial emphasis on the human element, advocating for a softer approach to IT. Together, their expertise ensures the seamless implementation of new technologies and fosters a shared sense of ownership and understanding regarding IT investment decisions throughout the organisation.

Jonas and Mathilde have played a pivotal role in influencing and shaping the present study. Their invaluable guidance and profound knowledge have resulted in numerous references within the subsequent text. Their willingness to share their advice and expertise reflects their generosity and unwavering commitment to advancing the understanding of the subject matter.

## The IT Investment Process

Vejle Municipality's IT investment process, facilitated through an online webform accessible via the intranet, was designed to streamline the procurement of new technologies. The webform's primary objectives are to ensure that the IT department remains cognizant of the technologies it supports and to connect the appropriate IT personnel with the investment project, thereby ensuring a smooth implementation and comprehensive consideration of potential implications.

The webform's user interface presents a clear directive to the municipality's employees:

> "If you need to solve a new IT task, update or add to an existing system, have an idea for an IT system or buy a new IT system, the City Council has decided that you must use the IT investment process. By using the IT investment process, we jointly ensure that the system or function can be used and at the same time meets our IT requirements. When you follow the investment process, you will also receive referrals to other departments if there are areas you need to pay attention to, for example information security."

This statement is followed by a list of examples that delineate when to use the IT investment process. These examples range from exploring existing solutions in the municipality, making changes to current systems, seeking IT support for a process, to buying new equipment requiring network access, or implementing a completely new IT solution.

To commence the process, employees must fill in an electronic form available on the page. Once completed, an architect from the IT department typically contacts the individual within 48 hours. This initiation is followed by further dialogue involving the employee, the supplier, and a representative from the IT department, ultimately resulting in feedback that includes an overall IT assessment of the system. In this assessment, additional references to other departments in Vejle Municipality are provided if needed, such as Competition Suspension.

Despite these comprehensive instructions and the broad scope of its applicability, the webform's usage among employees remains surprisingly limited. In recent years, the webform has been substantially simplified, removing intricate questions that non-IT personnel found challenging. This change was intended to enhance the webform's accessibility and boost its usage, but it has not led to substantial success.

In the report that follows, I will probe into the reasons behind this lack of adherence to the IT investment process and propose strategies to improve compliance. This study will examine the intricacies of the issue and offer suggestions for increasing the webform's usage, thereby enhancing the efficiency of IT investments within Vejle Municipality.

## The Challenge at Hand

In recent years, the webform has undergone a significant simplification in an effort to enhance its accessibility and, consequently, its usage. Jonas informed that the form had been significantly shortened as it previously included detailed questions that non-IT personnel found challenging to answer. This simplification aimed to encourage more staff to use the webform instead of directly contacting the IT architects or other IT department members. However, this effort has not met with substantial success.

In light of these findings, the study's primary aim is to explore why employees are not consistently adhering to the IT investment process and propose strategies to bolster compliance. In the report that follows, the intricacies of this issue will be investigated, and solutions to increase the usage of the webform will be proposed.

## Scope and Research Question

The study's primary aim is to explore why employees are not consistently adhering to the IT investment process and propose strategies to bolster compliance. As part of this investigation, employees spanning Vejle Municipality's diverse organisational structure were interviewed. This selection incorporated a broad range of roles and backgrounds, such as school teachers, system administrators, and daycare workers. Each of these twelve interviews provided valuable insights into employees' perspectives, their understanding of the process, and their suggestions for improving it.

However, an interesting trend has emerged during the course of this investigation. Despite clear guidelines for IT procurement, there are instances where employees have independently purchased new IT systems without prior consultation with the IT department. This approach, often accompanied by unrealistic expectations about implementation timelines, exacerbates the Municipality's compliance issue. As such, this study advocates for a user-centred approach, building empathy with end-users rather than viewing it solely as a management problem.

## GPT-4 and Qualitative Research

An innovative aspect of this study lies in its employment of OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), more specifically, its fourth iteration (GPT-4). This advanced Large Language Model (LLM) served as a complementary tool to the traditional research methodologies, particularly in developing an understanding of employees' attitudes and behaviours towards the IT investment process.

The LLM's unique ability to handle a considerable volume of detailed text input, combined with its capacity to output insightful analysis, was leveraged throughout this study. Notably, GPT-4 can accept up to 8,000 tokens with the 8K model and an impressive 32,000 tokens with the 32K model, each token averaging roughly 0.75 words in English text [@openaiPricing]. Consequently, this tool is able to analyse and draw insights from an enormous amount of text data.

One innovative application of GPT-4 was its use in creating an affinity diagram from interview notes, hoping to glean fresh perspectives from the extensive data gathered. This process, however, met with limited success. Despite the application of bicameral dialogue, a technique where the expresses simulated thoughts by entering in dialogue with itself, the resulting diagrams did not meet the anticipated expectations. Further research into the limitations and potential applications of GPT-4 in this context is proposed.

## Methodology and Structure

This study adopts an in-depth ethnographic approach, leveraging semi-structured interviews to gather rich data. Given the relatively small number of individuals directly involved in IT investments within the municipality, this qualitative method provided a means of engaging deeply with the subject matter.

The research is organised into several distinct sections, beginning with a literature review, followed by a detailed methodology chapter, and culminating in data presentation and analysis. The final chapters offer concrete recommendations to Vejle Municipality for improving compliance with the IT investment process, evaluating the utility and limitations of GPT-4 in the context of this study, and highlighting potential areas for future research.

## Contributions and Future Research Opportunities

This study, embedded in the field of IT investment governance and resource-based theory, seeks to contribute significantly to the existing body of knowledge, particularly in the context of Danish municipalities. It aims to provide Vejle Municipality with practical, actionable recommendations to enhance compliance with their IT investment process. In addition, it opens the door to the potential utility and limitations of LLMs as qualitative research tools in ethnographic studies.

Moreover, the application of a bicameral dialogue approach in order to generate an affinity diagram hints at exciting opportunities for future research. The exploration of GPT-4 as a tool for analysing and interpreting large qualitative data sets is a burgeoning area of study, and this research adds to that discourse.

The understanding of IT investment governance can be further extended by comparing practices across different municipalities or other public/non-profit organisations. In particular, the combination of ethnographic methodologies with a stronger focus on managerial and communication studies could form an exciting area of future research.

This research aims to contribute to a nuanced understanding of the issues at play in the governance of IT investments, particularly in the context of public administration. It offers valuable insights that could guide future research in this area, and potentially, help shape best practices in IT investment governance.
