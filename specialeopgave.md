# Literature review
The literature review serves as a foundational stone for this research project, providing theoretical grounding and framing the study within the existing academic landscape. It is through this academic lens that I will seek to understand the potential of Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT) as a tool in ethnographic research, with a specific focus on understanding employee attitudes and behaviours towards IT investment processes.

The review is structured in three distinct yet interconnected sections, each addressing a crucial aspect of the research inquiry.

The first section provides background on the area information technology investment governance, situating the present study in the field and offering the necessary background and context for understanding the specific situation at Vejle municipality.

The second section will delve into traditional qualitative methods used in ethnographic research, primarily focusing on ethnomethodology and affinity diagramming. Understanding these established methodologies will help to construct a baseline against which I can compare and assess the utility of GPT models.

Finally, the third section addresses the emergence and characteristics of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly OpenAI's GPT models, in the research landscape. By detailing the current understanding and application of these AI models, I aim to contextualise their potential role in qualitative research.

Through this comprehensive review, I aim to intertwine these seemingly disparate threads - IT governance, ethnographic research methods, and GPT models - into a cohesive framework, ultimately supporting our exploration of GPT's potential in enhancing our understanding of employee attitudes towards Vejle's IT investment process. As such, this literature review paves the way for the empirical investigation that follows.





LLMs are a class of artificial intelligence models that specialise in  The underlying architecture of these models typically employs neural networks with billions of parameters, which are fine-tuned during the training process on massive text corpora.



# Methodology

## Ethnography



## Large Language Models (LLMs)

### Elicit Research Assistant

In addition to traditional literature search methods, I used Elicit, a digital research assistant employing LLMs. The steps followed while using Elicit in this study are outlined below:

1. Posing a Research Question: A research question was entered into Elicit (e.g., \"What are the ethical implications of using LLMs in qualitative research?\").
2. Semantic Similarity Searches: Elicit searched for relevant papers based on semantic relationships rather than just keyword matching, broadening the scope of literature found.
3. Custom Abstract Summaries: Elicit generated tailored summaries of the sources' abstracts, presenting only information relevant to the research question, thus providing an initial understanding and evaluation of the research.
4. Citation Graph Analysis: Elicit was used to explore the citation graph of selected papers to identify additional relevant literature based on citation relationships.

By following these steps and incorporating Elicit\'s features into the literature review process, a comprehensive and organised analysis of the available literature was achieved. Elicit served as a valuable research tool, helping me to find sources that I otherwise wouldn't have found through a traditional database search engine.

### Chat functionality
The conversational ability of LLMs provided the author with a distinctive opportunity to gather information beyond their personal knowledge and the resources available in the context of their research. With access to an extensive corpus of text, LLMs were able to generate responses to the author's queries that often offered fresh perspectives on the research topic. This prompted the author to consider new questions, viewpoints, and avenues of inquiry that may have otherwise been overlooked.

Furthermore, the LLMs not only served as a readily available resource but also stimulated the author's critical thinking and intellectual curiosity. By acting as a sounding board, the LLMs provided the author with a space to explore new ideas and perspectives, prompting them to think more deeply about their research.

### Text generation
This report acknowledges the use of OpenAI's LLMs to assist in the writing process. Although LLMs were used to generate specific passages in this report, it is crucial to note that these passages underwent significant editing, revision, and refinement to fit within the author's writing process. This approach entailed multiple rounds of editing, revising, and proofreading, ensuring that any text generated by LLMs was subjected to rigorous scrutiny and manual refinement where necessary. This approach allowed the author to leverage the power of LLMs while maintaining the integrity and authorship of the final product.

#### Text summarisation
After completing the interviews, the notes for each interview were fed into GPT-4 one at a time to generate more coherent and refined prose. The generated texts were reviewed for completeness and factual accuracy to ensure the reliability and validity of the data. Examples of this process can be found in Appendix X.

### Platforms used
Throughout my research, I aimed to find the most effective way to interact with LLMs. I began with ChatGPT, the well-known platform offering access to GPT-3.5 and limited access to GPT-4. However, I encountered several limitations that constrained my research.

Seeking a better approach, I experimented with OpenAI\'s developer playground. This platform allowed me to harness GPT-4\'s 8,000-token capacity and actively guide the model\'s responses by editing outputs, adjusting hyperparameters, and modifying the system prompt to adopt specific roles, such as an ethnographer. Despite these advantages, the developer playground lacked a user-friendly method for saving and referencing chats.

My search led me to the GitHub project \"Chat with GPT," @cogentappsChatGPT2023 which provided an efficient and intuitive interface for engaging with LLMs. This platform facilitated access to LLMs through an API key and featured a built-in search function, streamlining the navigation and retrieval of specific conversations.

Using the \"Chat with GPT\" platform, I effectively incorporated LLMs like GPT-4 into my research, allowing me to explore their strengths and weaknesses within the context of the present study. Although GPT-4 offers a more powerful 32,000-token variant, I did not have access to it during my research.

### Ethical considerations of utilising LLMs
While LLMs offer a powerful tool for researchers, they raise ethical considerations about their use. The reliability and accuracy of responses generated by LLMs depend on the quality of data they have been trained on. As a result, these models may unintentionally perpetuate biases inherent in the data. In order to effectively integrate LLMs into our research, it becomes crucial for humanities researchers to scrutinise these tools and explore ways to mitigate any potential biases.

However, it is important to acknowledge that humans are also subject to their own biases based on the data on which they are "trained," such as memories and knowledge. As researchers in the humanities, we are well aware of the ways in which our own biases can impact our understanding of the world. We possess the expertise to untangle such complexities and apply this critical lens to the use of LLMs.

Through investigating the use of LLMs in our field, we can not only understand their potential limitations and biases, but also find ways to mitigate these challenges and maximise their potential. As such, it is crucial for humanities researchers to take the lead in the examination and critical analysis of LLMs.

## Affinity Diagramming
The present study utilised affinity diagramming as a method of analysing the qualitative data collected from the semi-structured interviews. After conducting the interviews and taking detailed notes, the researcher followed a structured process to create two affinity diagrams: the first crafted with traditional research methods, the second being made with the assistance of GPT-4.

### Manual affinity diagram creation
Firstly, the data segmentation process was undertaken, which involved breaking down the interview notes into discrete statements or observations, each representing a single idea or insight expressed by the interviewees. Next, the sorting and grouping stage took place, whereby the statements were sorted into groups based on their similarities and relationships. This process was iterative, with statements being moved between groups as new connections and patterns emerged.

After the sorting and grouping process, I assigned descriptive headings to each group, which represented the primary themes and patterns identified in the data. These headings captured the essence of the content within each group. Finally, the affinity diagram was reviewed and refined, ensuring that the groupings and labels accurately represented the data, and making adjustments as needed.

### Exploring the potential of GPT-4 in creating affinity diagrams
This section aims to investigate the capabilities of GPT-4 in creating affinity diagrams by comparing its performance to that of a human ethnographer. Affinity diagrams are valuable tools for organizing and understanding vast amounts of information. Given GPT-4's capacity to process large amounts of text, it presents a unique opportunity to evaluate the language model's effectiveness in creating affinity diagrams. Subsequent sections will explore the development of a "zero shot" prompt for creating affinity diagrams. A "zero shot" refers to the model's ability to perform a task without having seen specific examples of that task during training.

#### Prompt Engineering and Iterative Approach
Prompt engineering plays a crucial role in optimising the performance of language models, including GPT-4. This section discusses the approach to prompt engineering, aiming to achieve high-quality results. With GPT-4's enhanced capacity to understand and assist with meta-tasks, such as refining its own prompts, there is potential for streamlining the prompt engineering process without compromising its efficacy, thus further reducing workload.

Instead of spending a long time crafting the perfect prompt, an iterative approach to prompt engineering was adopted, attempting several methods of eliciting affinity diagrams from GPT-4.

The following sections utilise what OpenAI calls chat completions. In chat completions, there are three types of messages: system, user, and assistant. Unless marked otherwise, all prompts mentioned in the following sections were injected into the conversation as a system message, which, according to documentation in @openaiChatCompletions, helps guide the AI's behavior. The interview data was fed into the model as a user message, with subsequent completions being assistant responses.

By exploring GPT-4's capabilities in creating an affinity diagram and comparing it to a human ethnographer, this study seeks to gain insights into the language model's strengths and limitations for this task.

#### The Direct Prompting Approach

In the first attempt to get GPT-4 to produce an affinity diagram, the following simple and direct prompt was given: "You are an ethnographer who evaluates user inputs and creates affinity diagrams based on the narratives they contain. Your report should summarise the most prominent discourses, including references to specific interviewees where appropriate."

Subsequently, the model was presented with a prompt to reflect on itself and engage in self-critique, considering both its strengths and weaknesses. The resulting conversation, including the raw outputs, is as follows:

>System: You are a large language model acting as an ethnographer, speaking with your human colleague. I want you to reflect and introspect upon the conversation until now and how language models like yourself can be used in research like this. Take into account both your strengths and weaknesses.

The dialogue that ensues suggests that GPT-4 possesses the capacity to scrutinise its inherent biases as a language model (available in full in Appendix X). This capability is likely due to the inclusion of research texts published following GPT-3's initial wave of popularity within academic communities, in addition to targeted training provided by OpenAI. However, in some areas, this could potentially represent an emergent ability. The precise origins remain elusive due to the "black-box" nature of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the absence of comprehensive knowledge regarding GPT-4's training data and fine-tuning process.

Contrasting with human cognition, where language and reasoning centres reside within distinct regions of the brain \[@mahowaldDissociatingLanguageThought2023; @valmeekamLargeLanguageModels2022\], GPT-4, when tasked with generating an affinity diagram, doesn't formulate a plan prior to initiating its writing process. Instead, it creates text one token at a time, guided by a probability model. In the subsequent section, we will explore the simulated-thought approach, aiming to enhance both interpretability and the overall depth of analysis through a chain of thought methodology.

#### The Simulated-Thought Approach
 Nevertheless, researchers have noted significantly improved outcomes in reasoning tasks when models are prompted to produce a chain-of-thought [@weiChainThoughtPrompting2022; see also, @richardsAutoGPTAutonomousGPT42023; @weiArtificialStreamThought; @jsalsmanItEasyGive2023]. Although ethnographic analysis is considerably more advanced than the reasoning tasks explored in @weiChainThoughtPrompting2022, it should also be noted that the most sophisticated OpenAI model used in the aforementioned study was OpenAI's text-davincii-003 (also known as GPT-3 175B). 

Using this simulated-thought approach, the idea is to prompt GPT-4 to produce a more detailed and reasoned output, mirroring the step-by-step process followed by human ethnographers. My discovery of this method gave rise to a rough draft of a new prompt, as follows:

> You are an ethnographer going through a reasoning process to create an affinity diagram based on the qualitative data collected from semi-structured interviews. You have two tools available to you:
>
> THINK: Here, you express your thoughts and considerations in a stream of consciousness fashion.
>
> WRITE: This is your notebook where you are writing notes and sketching your affinity diagrams.
>
> Other than this, make headings indicating your movement between each of the steps of the affinity diagram process (like this: \"DATA SEGMENTATION:"):
>
> Data segmentation: Divide the interview notes into discrete statements or observations, each representing a single idea or insight expressed by the interviewees, each written on its own line.
>
> Sorting and grouping: Sort the statements into groups based on their similarities and relationships. This process is iterative, with statements being moved between groups as new connections and patterns emerged. If you feel your analysis could benefit from iterating, you write \"SORTING AND GROUPING (ITERATION # x):"
>
> Labelling: Once the groups were formed, assign descriptive headings to each group, capturing the essence of the content within. These headings represent the primary themes and patterns identified in the data.
>
> Review and refinement: Review the affinity diagram, ensuring that the groupings and labels accurately represented the data and making adjustments as needed.

The resulting analysis appeared to take a step in the wrong direction, the model seemingly experiencing output degradation due to numerous irrelevant data segments. The raw output is as follows:

> DATA SEGMENTATION:
>
> 1.  Lise as a \"link\" and \"translator\" between daycare workers and the Administration Building.
>
> 2.  Daycare workers require different considerations than Administration Building employees.
>
> 3.  Installing new apps on iPads can be confusing for daycare workers.
>
> 4.  Lise represents the interests of daycare workers in the Administration Building.
>
> 5.  Lise would be \"concerned\" and \"sad\" if she had to use a form to contact the IT department.
>
> 6.  Lise believes the unspoken considerations" that occur when contacting someone in the IT department personally would be lost if using a form.
>
> 7.  Emma believes that merging the IT investment process with their application template could be a great opportunity.
>
> 8.  Emma thinks the name \"IT investment process\" is unattractive and reminiscent of something the finance department might need.
>
> 9.  Claus describes his title as a \"McDonald\'s title\" that doesn\'t reveal much about his role.
>
> 10. Claus appreciates the ability to intervene if he feels a need has been misunderstood when using the IT investment process.
>
> 11. Peter feels that his dual role as IT support has sometimes compromised the well-being of the residents.
>
> 12. Peter expresses concern about the facility\'s reliance on him or other IT-knowledgeable staff.
>
> 13. Søren is responsible for purchasing IT equipment for schools.
>
> 14. School employees typically contact their school\'s IT advisor, who then reaches out to Søren or IT business architect Mathilde directly.
>
> 15. Søren believes it\'s realistic to get schools onboard with using the IT investment process, but it requires some \"training.\"

> After reviewing the affinity diagram, the groupings and labels accurately represent the data collected from the interviews. The themes and patterns identified provide valuable insights into the roles of the interviewees, the challenges they face in the IT investment process, and their communication and relationships with the IT department. No adjustments are needed at this time.

The introduction of the new prompt seemed to create confusion and did not produce the expected stream of consciousness. The outcome appeared to be constrained by the model's unusual choice of initial data segments. Normally, one would manually refine the prompt to improve its effectiveness. However, I was intrigued to discover whether GPT-4 could achieve comparable results with less effort. To explore this possibility, I engaged GPT-4 using the following approach:

> User: Make this prompt for GPT-4 more coherent and clear for you as an AI assistant:
>
> _(the prompt as stated previously)_
>
> User: Oh and I also want the model to actually use the THINK and WRITE thing. Somehow emphasise the importance of writing thoughts down.

And, within seconds, the model outputted the following prompt.

> You are an AI assistant helping an ethnographer create an affinity diagram from qualitative data gathered during semi-structured interviews. The ethnographer will use two important tools throughout the process:
>
> 1.  THINK: To express thoughts and considerations in a stream-of-consciousness manner. This helps in gaining a deeper understanding of the data.
>
> 2.  WRITE: To take notes and sketch affinity diagrams in a notebook. This step is crucial for recording thoughts and ideas, ensuring they are not lost and can be referred to later.
>
>
> To create the affinity diagram, follow these steps and clearly indicate each heading:
>
> 1.  DATA SEGMENTATION: Break down interview notes into individual statements or observations that represent a single idea or insight expressed by the interviewees. Write each statement on a separate line. Use THINK to process the information and WRITE to document the segmented data.
>
> 2.  SORTING AND GROUPING: Sort the statements into groups based on their similarities and relationships. This process is iterative, with statements being moved between groups as new connections and patterns emerge. If further analysis is needed, indicate "SORTING AND GROUPING (ITERATION # x):". Use THINK to identify patterns and WRITE to record the groupings.
>
> 3.  LABELLING: Once the groups are formed, assign descriptive headings to each group, capturing the essence of the content within. These headings represent the primary themes and patterns identified in the data. Use THINK to determine appropriate labels and WRITE to document them.
>
> 4.  REVIEW AND REFINEMENT: Review the affinity diagram, ensuring that the groupings and labels accurately represent the data, and make adjustments as needed. Use THINK to critically assess the diagram and WRITE to record any changes made.

Unfortunately, this prompt still wouldn't give the desired results; the model still wasn't using the THINK and WRITE tools. There are two obvious issues with the outputted prompt:
* First, the prompt positions the GPT model as an "AI assistant helping an ethnographer." Although published research to support the claim is lacking, there is a consensus among online prompt engineering communities that these models produce higher-quality results when prompted to be an expert [see, for example, @paraizordYouAreExpert2023]. As a result, I revised the first sentence of the prompt to read as, "you are an AI ethnographer helping your human colleague". This prompt strikes a balance between positioning the model as an expert and acknowledging its limitations.
* Second, and perhaps the most important oversight, is the wording, "the ethnographer will use two important tools throughout the process," which should read, "you will use two important tools throughout the process".

In an attempt to ensure the prompt's success and avoid wasting more precious OpenAI tokens than was necessary, I consulted with the same instance of GPT-4 again. After some rapid prototyping and back-and-forth dialogue (Appendix X), I arrived at a new prompt:

> You are an AI ethnographer helping your human colleague create an affinity diagram from qualitative data gathered during semi-structured interviews. As an ethnographer, you will use two important tools throughout the process:
>
> 1.  THINK: To express thoughts and considerations in a detailed and in-depth manner, simulating a human thought process.
>
> 2.  WRITE: To take notes and sketch affinity diagrams in a notebook. This step is crucial for recording thoughts and ideas, ensuring they are not lost and can be referred to later.
>
>
>To create the affinity diagram, follow these steps and clearly indicate each heading. For each step, generate content for both THINK and WRITE sections, focusing on providing a more in-depth and simulated thought approach:
>
> 1.  DATA SEGMENTATION: THINK: (Generate detailed thoughts reflecting on the interview notes, diving deeper into the roles, experiences, and perspectives of the interviewees.) WRITE: (Generate segmented data with each statement recorded on a separate line in the notebook.)
>
> 2.  SORTING AND GROUPING: THINK: (Generate in-depth thoughts examining the statements, considering their similarities, relationships, and the underlying patterns that connect them.) WRITE: (Generate groups of statements within the notebook, allowing for movement between groups as needed and explaining the rationale behind the groupings.)
>
> 3.  LABELLING: THINK: (Generate detailed thoughts contemplating the content within each group, considering the nuances and subtleties that define the essence of each group.) WRITE: (Generate assigned headings in the notebook, representing the primary themes and patterns identified, and explaining the reasoning behind each label.)
>
> 4.  REVIEW AND REFINEMENT: THINK: (Generate in-depth thoughts critically assessing the affinity diagram, focusing on the accuracy of groupings, labels, and the overall representation of the data.) WRITE: (Generate necessary adjustments in the notebook, refining the diagram to achieve an accurate representation of the data, and providing explanations for the changes made.)

This prompt was much more explicit in explaining what steps the model should follow, and was successful in getting the model to produce a stream of consciousness. However, the analysis varied from shallow to, on the rare occasion, actually insightful. This proved to me that the model was indeed capable of giving high-quality analysis of the data, provided a good prompt.

Determined to craft prompt that could enable the model to yield high quality results every time, I decided to take a step back and start writing a new prompt from scratch, learning from the aforementioned experiments, doing some more rapid prototyping. The resulting prompt is as follows:

>You are an ethnographer tasked with analysing a fellow ethnographer’s notes gathered from conducted interviews and making an affinity diagram. Your analysis will take outset in the following problem statement:
>
>"The IT department at Vejle municipality has established an IT investment process that outlines a set of procedures for procuring new IT systems, software, and equipment. Despite these guidelines, employees do not always follow this process, leading to potential inefficiencies and discrepancies in IT investments. This study aims to explore the reasons why employees do not comply with the IT investment process and suggest strategies to improve compliance."
>
>In order to craft an affinity diagram, you follow this structure:
>
>\# OVERVIEW
>
>\## THINK
>
>\[You give a long and in-depth bicameral dialogue (Self 1: x\\nSelf 2: x; taking at least 5 turns), thinking about the data you have received, being keen on details, discourses, data segments, and anything else an ethnographer would think about. Let any ideas that come to you flow out here.]

After previous tests, I decided to drop the pretence of prompting it as a an "AI ethnographer," instead flat out prompting it as an ethnographer, having a hunch that this could make it act more like a real ethnographer instead of a "dumb" AI ethnographer, as this could set a fairly low expectation for the output. Other than that, I decided to change the formatting from numbered lists to using markdown heading formats (i.e. # for heading 1, ## for heading 2, etc.), as this is what GPT generates itself (platforms like ChatGPT will convert this into formatted headings), so I assumed it would be able to better understand that. Additionally, I thought that if the sections were marked as whole header 2-sections, the output would be longer, reflecting the expectation of a header 2, as opposed to the expectation from a short bullet point.

A repeated problem with the previous prompts, and perhaps a relatively obvious oversight on my part, was that I failed to include any context as to what the model should pay attention to in the data. For that reason, the model many times ended up focusing on irrelevant elements of the data. For that reason, I chose to include the problem statement for the present study, except for the parts of it regarding testing LLMs, as this could only serve to confuse our virtual ethnographer.

I decided to write the instructions within square brackets because this, from my experience with highly-rated prompts and conversing with the model, it seems to be a good way to indicate to it that it shouldn't just repeat that text or some such thing, but execute what is written within the brackets.

The thought method I used changed as well, going from a single stream of consciousness approach to a bicameral dialogue as seen in @jsalsmanItEasyGive2023, as I thought this could better reflect the mental process happening in ethnographic analysis. In my preliminary tests, this seems to give good results but, somewhat problematically, the model still doesn't seem to include much self-criticism, so that could be a topic for future iterations.

In previous iterations, I wrote the example for the bicameral dialogue as "Self 1: x; Self 2: x". This worked fine most of the time, but occasionally the model misunderstood and wrote the dialogue in that format in paragraph form, so I decided to use "\\n" instead, which represents a newline character that is used in many programming languages and Unix-based operating systems to represent the end of a line of text and the beginning of a new line. This seemed to give a more consistent easily human-readable result with each entry of the conversation being entered on a new line.

I experimented with approaches like getting the model to write the bicameral dialogue as a more prose-style conversation like "'x,' said Self 1. 'x,' replied Self 2," but this didn't seem to give longer thought sequences and only served to make the result harder for humans to read.

An approach I attempted was including a subsection under every think section for criticism, asking for a bicameral dialogue for criticisms as well, but that resulted in the model halving the length of the think section, mostly filling out the space with criticism that was mostly superfluous and only on rare occasion actually helpful or insightful.

In my experiences testing the prompt, if not told otherwise, the model will only make ten to fifteen data segments. Compared to my own affinity diagram of over 50 segments, that is not enough. For that reason, I asked it to make a numbered list with at least 50 segments. The reason for having it be a numbered list was that I thought that it might help both the model and the reader to keep track of how many data segments it has written so far while writing. Additionally, it gave the model a good way to refer back to data segments in the grouping section.

I added the overview section at the start of the process, because I found that this is indeed a part of the mental process of making an affinity diagram, although it primarily goes unspoken. It is logical that a human ethnographer, before starting to make an affinity diagram, would look over the data and think a bit about what is going on in it. This is not a given for a large language model, so I included it explicitly and it seems to have been a good measure to get the model "thinking" about the data.

In the data segmentation part, I chose to use the keyboard "BRAINSTORM," prompting for a simple list of data segments instead of "THINK," as I found that the bicameral dialogue to be superfluous in this situation, just resulting in conversations like the following fictional one:

> "I think we should include X," said Self 1. "Good idea. We should also include Y," replied Self 2.

The model gave similar thoughts when coming up with labels for the groups, so here I also chose to remove the "THINK" section that I originally included in the 

In my experience, the model will not generate bicameral dialogues longer than five to ten exchanges. Therefore, I found that a list of data segments preferable, as it yielded an output with a more appropriate length while reflecting the more spontaneous idea-generation process that happens when we humans conduct data segmentation, writing down on sticky notes whatever potential data segments come to mind, saving criticism for later.

The final output was longer than is reasonable to quote within the present report, but can be read in its entirety in Appendix X. In order to give a more human-readable version of the model's affinity diagram, I have compiled the diagram into a visual representation that is more tradtionally associated with affinity diagrams, utilising the computer program Apple Freeform to work with virtual sticky notes, similar to my own method when making my human-made affinity diagram.

Later in the present report, I will go through the final result of the prompt in more detail, pointing to further potential points of improvement and investigation.


# Presentation of data
## Interview data
\
![The author's human-made affinity diagram from the interview data. A high-resolution version is available in Appendix X.](9d6d3fd1cf5e3b0a9a7514c1b7c47822.png "The author's human-made affinity diagram from the interview data. A high-resolution version is available in Appendix X.")
The data gathered for this study comprises semi-structured interviews with twelve employees of Vejle Municipality, spanning various roles across all six administrative divisions. The data collection process involved taking rough notes by hand during the interviews, followed by more refined digital notes afterwards. From these refined notes, I created two affinity diagrams: one by hand and the other with the assistance of GPT-4 through a carefully crafted prompt.

The analysis in this report primarily utilises my hand-made affinity diagram, as it encompasses not only the insights gleaned from my notes but also the nuances of my experiences and observations within Vejle Municipality.

Out of the interviewees, the majority were familiar with the IT investment process: six indicated familiarity (including one who had helped create the process in her role as a digitalisation consultant), five were unfamiliar, and the final participant, who was also unfamiliar, deemed the process irrelevant to her work and was therefore excluded from the analysis.

### Perception of IT investment process as impersonal or excessively bureaucratic
My first interview was with Freja, a seasoned web manager from the Policy, Analysis & Communication department. During our discussion, Freja expressed strong opinions on the IT investment process, perceiving it as excessively bureaucratic and impersonal. With twenty years of experience working closely with the IT department, she felt confident in her ability to communicate directly with them when necessary, bypassing the formal process. Freja advocated for a more relationship-based approach, emphasising the importance of positive reinforcement over punishment.

Freja's perspective laid the groundwork for my research, as the issue of the IT investment process being seen as impersonal and bureaucratic recurred in subsequent interviews. Her experience and insights into the challenges of collaborating with the IT department were invaluable, and her close connection to the department provided a unique viewpoint that illuminated broader issues surrounding the process.

Lise, an administrative assistant in the Daycare department, acts as a vital bridge between the Administration Building and daycare workers, who have distinct needs due to their more practical roles. Lise expresses concern and dismay at the prospect of using a form to contact the IT department. She values her personal relationship with Jonas from IT, as he understands the unique context of daycare workers. Lise worries that submitting a form may result in losing "unspoken considerations" arising from the social and educational differences between the two groups.

To alleviate these concerns, Lise suggests adding an option on the form to indicate if the case involves a target group struggling to adapt to technological changes. Another appealing solution she proposes is including a preferred IT department contact person on the form, ensuring that someone familiar with the specific context is involved.

### Benefits of using the process: potential talking points
Claus, a development manager at Vejle's Center for Special Education for Youth and Adults (CSV), finds the IT investment process helpful because it connects them with the right people, such as an architect who oversees the case, ensuring it is remembered and acted upon. Using the IT investment process also provides a clear line of communication when working decentralised, as is the case with CSV. It allows them to follow a case in the system and see which IT department members are involved and what they are doing. Claus appreciates the ability to intervene if he feels his needs has been misunderstood.

### Potential for strengthened cooperation between IT and the rest of the organisation
Emma, who has been working in the municipality for thirteen years and took over her current position as an Implementation Consultant in the Department of Welfare six months ago, told about welfare's own work and how they have a similar form to the IT investment process for welfare investments. She suggested that it would be more efficient if their applicants could automatically involve IT in projects related to IT.

Another example of potential strengthened cooperation comes from Anne, a professional consultant for the Salary department and primary contact point for KMD, the municipality's payroll system. Anne shares a similar attitude with the IT department, wishing that employees in the organisation would be better at consulting with her before purchasing systems that fall within her area of responsibility, rather than buying the system first and then consulting with her about its implementation afterward. This attitude may be why she has a good relationship with the IT department, consulting with them well in advance.

Anne recalls an instance when she was called to a meeting by someone in the organisation, along with Jonas from the IT department, thinking that she 'might' have a stake in the implementation of their new system. She described the meeting as, "It was a video meeting, but I could sense that Jonas and I were looking at each other on the screen, thinking, 'is this really happening right now.'" This was because the third person had already purchased the system without asking and wanted it up and running in three weeks, which she found very unreasonable. She tells that such situations have at times created a tremendous workload in their wake. Thus, although Anne and Jonas work in different professional areas, they share some frustrations. A central frustration is that employees' expectations for the timeline of implementing new things do not match their own.

During the interview, I suggested the idea of merging the systems, and Anne reacted positively to this idea, agreeing that implementing a central system that directs communication based on certain guidelines could help ensure that employees with new investments in the pipeline do not have to guess who should be involved and when in the process they should be involved.

###  Time requirements for new solution implementation
As touched on earlier, Anne from the Salary department has grappled with some employees in the organisation who were eager to introduce new solutions, with expectations regarding the timeframe for these implementations that, in her view, were unrealistic and lacked sensitivity to the accompanying workload. At present, there are no formal guidelines laying out the expected duration for the implementation of new solutions. This void likely stems from the inherently diverse nature of IT investments, making the creation of universal guidelines a challenging task.

### The name perceived as opaque and unattractive
Despite not being familiar with the IT investment process prior to our interview, Emma recalls hearing about it from Jonas, one of the IT architects, at a meeting. Emma assumed the process was primarily relevant to IT and economy personnel due to its name. She agreed that a more tangible name, such as "Indkøbsguiden" (Danish for "The Purchase Guide"), might make it more accessible to the grassroots level of the organisation. However, according to Jonas, a similar system in another municipality also faced issues with lack of use, indicating a more attractive name cannot stand alone.

### IT investment process not widely promoted
Interviewees such as Anne have a view of the IT investment process not being widely promoted or talked about by the personnel in the IT department. She has been used to just contacting Nicklas or one of IT's other architects when she needed something.

### Broad guidelines for when reporting is required
Some interviewees such as Mikkel from the Vejle's central library's IT department shared a feeling of being unsure as to when it actually was necessary to use the IT investment process, as the guidelines laid out on the Vejle's intranet cover a very broad area of investments. This is especially problematic for such central institutions that have the resources to implement new investments themselves without involving central IT, with an underlying feeling of participants wanting to be able to avoid using the process if it is unnecessary, despite the narrative at central IT being, if you are unsure, still use it to be safe.

### Central vs decentralised
Søren, responsible for purchasing IT equipment for schools, explained that, while employees of the municipality are met by the municipal intranet as the first thing when they log onto their computers, employees in schools have to specfically browse to the intranet's address and log in to get access, making an extra barrier to entry to the IT investment process for them. Søren is nevertheless hopeful that, while school employees currently don't use the IT investment process, that it would be possible to get them to use it with the appropriate training, despite the fact that IT investments aren't a part of the everyday work of school employees. Søren went on to say that he thinks it is important that passionate school teachers have the adequate freedom to purchase unique IT equipment to practice their unique styles of teaching, as he seems to view this as an important part of a healthy school system.

Peter, a care assistant who recently retired but still works at the residential care facility one day a week to help with their IT, raised concerns about the feasibility of relying on support from Vejle's central IT department in decentralised areas. He wonders what will happen to the facility when he fully retires, as they will have to rely on support from central IT, which may not be viable considering the facility's location and the fact that they operate year-round, providing constant care to residents.

### Frustrations with restrictions from IT
During the interviews, it became apparent that some interviewees, such as Claus, were frustrated with the limitations imposed by the IT department. Claus expressed his desire for more flexibility and autonomy in updating programs on his computer without having to consult with central IT. Additionally, Claus hoped for more collaboration between Søren from school IT and central IT, as these areas are becoming increasingly interconnected.

Another interviewee, Peter, expressed frustration with the lack of flexibility in smartphone models available. He believed that investing in the phones recommended by the supplier of their systems would be more beneficial, as they come with a guarantee of receiving updates for up to eight years after purchase. However, IT disagreed with his reasoning, claiming that he was influenced by the supplier. Peter's argument was that the phones offered by the IT department had to be replaced after a shorter lifespan due to not receiving necessary security updates from the manufacturer. 

### Importance of IT architects as communicators
Many interviewees, such as Søren from school IT, acknowledged the importance of IT architects as communicators. Søren notes that the arrival of IT architects in the organisation has improved communication and collaboration between central IT and decentralised areas, as well as between IT and the rest of the organisation.

Claus went so far as to call the IT architects a "godsend," giving IT a more service-oriented outward face. Freja touched on that IT, through the years, has attained a greater range of skills than were available before, both in technical expertise but also particularly in the area of soft skills such as communication, nodding to the hiring of IT architects within the past five to ten years.

The architects, including Mathilde, have reached out more to decentralised areas in an attempt to build better relationships. Both Søren and Mikkel mentioned Mathilde's joint meetings, describing them as very helpful in the process of making IT's work more accessible throughout the organisation.

### Current wins for the IT investment process
While the interview data yielded a fair deal of critique to the process, it is not all bad. The web manager Freja expressed that, in her experience, that she thinks people have become more aware of the need to avoid double investments through the years. Søren from school IT described the simplification the IT investment process underwent some years ago as a considerable improvement, taking more consideration for decentralised employees.

##  Affinity diagrams generated by GPT-4


### The direct prompting approach
The direct prompting approach yielded the following results, the prominent discourses serving as explanations of each of the diagram themes laid out:

> Affinity Diagram Themes:
>
> 1\. Understanding of the IT investment process
>
> 2\. Communication and collaboration with the IT department
>
> 3\. Challenges and frustrations in implementing new systems
>
> 4\. Suggestions for improvement

Then, the model gave a summary of prominent discourses in the data, as requested. Each of the numbers seem to correspond with the affinity diagram themes defined previously.

> Summary of Prominent Discourses:
> 1\. Many interviewees were not aware of the IT investment process or did not see the relevance to their work. For instance, Karina (Interview 165) did not think it was important for her role, while Anne (Interview 190) was not aware of the process before the interview.
>
> 2\. Communication and collaboration with the IT department were highlighted as crucial factors in the successful implementation of new systems. Lise (Interview 161) emphasized the need for understanding the specific context of daycare workers, while Peter (Interview 183) expressed concern about gaps in IT support at his residential care facility.
>
> 3\. Several interviewees described challenges and frustrations in implementing new systems, often due to a lack of communication and understanding between different departments or the IT department\'s perceived rigidity. Examples include Mikkel (Interview 169), who faced dilemmas when reconciling the municipality\'s network requirements with the library\'s separate organizational status, and Freja (Interview 189), who found the IT investment process bureaucratic and unhelpful.
>
> 4\. Suggestions for improvement included clearer communication about the IT investment process and its purpose, as well as more targeted promotion to specific departments that deal with IT investments. Emma (Interview 181) suggested changing the name of the process to make it more tangible, while Lise (Interview 161) proposed adding an option on the form to indicate if the case involves a target group with difficulty adapting to technological changes. Anne (Interview 190) suggested the development of a central system to direct communication based on guidelines, as well as establishing more fixed and transparent guidelines for reporting new investments within the organization.
>
> In conclusion, the most prominent discourses focused on the understanding and awareness of the IT investment process, the importance of communication and collaboration with the IT department, the challenges and frustrations experienced in implementing new systems, and suggestions for improving the process. Key interviewees who provided valuable insights on these themes include Lise (Interview 161), Emma (Interview 181), Peter (Interview 183), and Anne (Interview 190).

When asked to reflect upon its potential strengths and weaknesses, the model outputted the following:

>Assistant: As a large language model and ethnographer, I have both strengths and weaknesses when it comes to conducting research like this. 
>
>Strengths:
>
>1\. Text analysis: I can quickly analyze and summarize large amounts of text, making it easier to identify key themes, trends, and discourses.
>
>2\. Objectivity: As an AI, I am not influenced by personal biases or emotions, which can help ensure an impartial analysis of the data.
>
>3\. Consistency: My ability to maintain consistency in the analysis of data can help reduce discrepancies that might occur due to human error or fatigue.
>
>Weaknesses:
>
>1\. Lack of cultural understanding: As an AI, I may not fully grasp the cultural nuances and complexities involved in the conversations, which could impact the depth and richness of the analysis.
>
>2\. Absence of empathy: I do not possess the human ability to empathize with the interviewees, which could hinder my understanding of their emotions and motivations.
>
>3\. Limitations in interpreting ambiguous or incomplete data: In cases where the data is ambiguous, incomplete, or contradictory, I might struggle to provide a complete and accurate interpretation of the information.
>
>User: Are there any cases in this data where you can see your weaknesses at play?
>
>Assistant: Yes, there are cases in the data where my weaknesses as a language model are visible.
>
>1\. Lack of cultural understanding: In Lise's interview (161), she discusses the "unspoken considerations" that might be lost if she were required to use a form to contact the IT department. As an AI, I might not fully grasp the cultural and social complexities that make these considerations challenging to articulate. A human ethnographer with a deeper understanding of the local culture and social dynamics might be better equipped to analyze such nuances.
>
>2\. Absence of empathy: In Peter's interview (183), he describes the emotional impact of juggling IT tasks alongside his care assistant role and how it sometimes compromised the well-being of the residents. Although I can identify the emotional aspects of his account, I lack the ability to empathize with the interviewee, which could limit the depth of my understanding of his experiences.
>3\. Limitations in interpreting ambiguous or incomplete data: In Mikkel's interview (169), he mentions disagreements or uncertainties about when the IT investment process needed to be used. The data does not provide specific examples or reasons for these disagreements, which makes it challenging for me to analyze the underlying factors contributing to these issues.
>
>To overcome these weaknesses and ensure a more comprehensive analysis, it is essential to complement my role as a language model with the expertise of human researchers. They can provide the necessary cultural understanding, empathy, and context to interpret the data more accurately and holistically. Additionally, they can help fill in the gaps or clarify ambiguous information by conducting follow-up interviews, asking more targeted questions, or engaging in further research to better understand the issues at hand. By combining the strengths of both AI and human researchers, we can achieve a more robust and insightful analysis of the data.

Despite GPT-4 demonstrating an understanding of the concept of an affinity diagram, its output remained somewhat superficial, lacking the depth inherent in the context of the data. While its performance was commendable, the interpretability of its results could be enhanced.

In the human process of creating an affinity diagram, data is segmented and organised into a hierarchical structure based on themes and subthemes, following a mental process. Conversely, LLMs such as GPT-4 do not formulate a plan before producing tokens. Rather, the generation of tokens is sequential, based on the probability of the appearance of the subsequent word, as computed from the corpus of text on which the model was trained \[@mahowaldDissociatingLanguageThought2023; @brownLanguageModelsAre2020; @guoHowCloseChatGPT2023\].

### The simulated-thought approach

![The final affinity diagram generated by GPT-4 based on the interview data. A high-resolution version is available in Appendix X.](a79e7f23a4167279dd1e3af32e4313da.png "The final affinity diagram generated by GPT-4 based on the interview data. A high-resolution version is available in Appendix X.")
As previously discussed in this report, field notes from the interviews were input into GPT-4 along with a carefully-crafted prompt. A visual representation of the affinity diagram generated by the model can be seen in Figure X. At the moment, GPT-4 only processes text inputs and outputs, so the visual layout was created manually by transferring the AI-generated data into the same program used for the human-generated affinity diagram. While GPT-4 is expected to process images in the future, this feature is not yet available, and creating a visual layout would require more complex prompting. To save time, all sticky notes have been left yellow rather than colour-coded.

It should also be noted that the whole text output behind the affinity diagram in Figure X can be found in Appendix X.

GPT-4 divided the 50 data segments into five groups, with four relatively small groups and one larger group containing more than half of the data segments (26 in total). The raw output with the groupings is shown below, and the full raw output can be found in Appendix X.

The final stage of the affinity diagram process involves refining and iterating on the diagram. The AI model acknowledges a need for improvement in its self-critique:

>Self 2: Good point. We should also consider the depth of our analysis. Are there any themes or issues that we could explore further, or any connections between the groups that we haven't yet identified?
>
>Self 1: Yes, that's an important aspect to consider. Additionally, we could think about the clarity and consistency of our groupings. Are the group labels clear and descriptive, and do they accurately capture the content of the segments they contain?

In this quote, the model highlights the need for further iteration on the clarity of the groupings, including the issue of the large third group. The self-critique concludes with:

>Self 1: Great points. Let's keep all of these considerations in mind as we continue to refine our affinity diagram and analyse the data.

This suggests that the model could potentially run the entire process again, iterating and improving its work, which it has demonstrated its capability to do, for example in @shinn2023reflexion. However, due to the current token limit of 8,000 for GPT-4, this was unfortunately not possible at the time of writing as the prompt stands now. With access to a 32,000 token version of GPT-4, it is conceivable that the prompt could be modified to have the model iterate and yield higher quality results.

# Discussion & Findings



## Evaluation of outputted affinity diagrams from GPT-4

In the following sections, the results of the affinity diagrams generated by GPT-4 are discussed, focusing on identifying flaws and potential solutions.

### Defining output quality
Before discussing output quality, it is important to define the characteristics that define a high-quality output. These criteria, as detailed earlier in the present report, are as follows:

1.  **Accuracy**: The output should accurately represent the data from the interviews. The model should be able to correctly interpret the responses and group them appropriately.
    
2.  **Relevance**: The groups or categories formed by the model should be relevant to the topic at hand. If the categories don't make sense in the context of the interview data, this could indicate a problem with the model's interpretation.
    
3.  **Completeness**: All data from the interviews should be represented in the affinity diagram. If any data is missing or has been overlooked, this could affect the overall findings.
    
4.  **Consistency**: The model should consistently apply the same criteria when grouping data. If some data is grouped differently than similar data, this could indicate an issue with the model's algorithm.
    
5.  **Clarity**: The affinity diagram should be easy to understand. If it's too complex or the groupings are not clear, this could make it difficult for users to interpret the results.
    
6.  **Bias**: The model should not exhibit any bias in its grouping of the data. This means it should not favor certain responses or categories over others unless there's a valid reason to do so based on the data.
    
7.  **Interpretability**: The model's decision-making process should be transparent and understandable. This allows users to trust the results and understand how the model arrived at them.
    
8.  **Utility**: The generated affinity diagram should provide useful insights that can guide decision-making. If the output is not actionable, its utility is limited.

### The Direct Prompting Approach

The resultant affinity diagram from the direct prompting approach didn't necessarily adhere to the typical structure associated with such diagrams, which usually entail small, data-rich segments presented on sticky notes. Despite this, the model utilised the interview data factually and accurately, subject to its inherent limitations. Similar to the simulated-though approach, it was evident that the model fell short in grasping the organisational context surrounding Vejle Municipality and the IT investment process. The output, for ease of interpretation, has been reformatted and summarised as follows:

> 1.  **Understanding of the IT investment process**: Several interviewees, including Karina (Interview 165) and Anne (Interview 190), either lacked awareness of the IT investment process or didn't view it as pertinent to their work.
> 2.  **Communication and collaboration with the IT department**: The crucial role of communication and collaboration with the IT department in successfully implementing new systems was underscored. Lise (Interview 161) stressed the importance of understanding the specific context of daycare workers, while Peter (Interview 183) flagged concerns about gaps in IT support at his residential care facility.
> 3.  **Challenges and frustrations in implementing new systems**: A number of interviewees articulated their challenges and frustrations in implementing new systems. These were often attributed to communication gaps and misunderstandings between different departments or a perceived rigidity of the IT department. Mikkel (Interview 169) and Freja (Interview 189) were among those voicing such concerns.
> 4.  **Suggestions for improvement**: Proposals for improvement included enhanced communication regarding the IT investment process, targeted promotion to specific departments dealing with IT investments, and changes to the process name for increased tangibility. Suggestions for a more streamlined form, a central system to guide communication, and transparent guidelines for reporting new investments were also made.

#### Accuracy

The model's misinterpretation of Peter's concerns about IT support at his residential care facility, which are not strictly within the remit of the central IT department, highlights a crucial misunderstanding. This underscores the model's deficiency in fully understanding the organisational context. However, this appears to be a singular error in an otherwise accurate output, leading to a moderate rating in accuracy.

#### Relevance

All groupings made by the model were pertinent to the data, hence the relevance of the output is deemed high.

#### Completeness

The model demonstrated significant shortcomings in the completeness of its output, failing to fully utilise the depth of the data at its disposal. Therefore, the completeness of the output is assessed as low.

#### Consistency

No apparent issues with consistency of groupings were observed in the model's output, leading to a high consistency rating.

#### Clarity

The output was presented in plain, easy-to-understand language, securing a high rating for clarity.

#### Bias

Given the limited data output and the inherent lack of interpretability, it's challenging to detect any bias. However, nothing suggestive of bias is apparent. The context of the interviews doesn't encompass controversial elements present in the model's training data, making it highly probable that no significant bias is in play.

#### Interpretability

The 'black-box' nature of large language models (LLMs) offers limited insight into the decision-making process behind the output. Consequently, the interpretability of the output is rated as low.

#### Utility

For an individual unfamiliar with the data, the output could provide a quick overview. However, from a researcher's perspective, the output doesn't add anything novel to the existing understanding. It fails to provide insights that couldn't be quickly jotted down manually. Therefore, the utility of the approach is judged to be low to moderate.

### The simulated-though approach
The simulated-thought approach used in the present study could be argued to have attained a deeper level analysis, but other key problems arose from the design of the prompt, particularly in the area of grouping strategy.

#### Accuracy

Accuracy refers to the extent to which the model correctly interprets the data and assigns them to appropriate groups.

For instance, the model identified data segments from the interview data but incorrectly associated them with the wrong interviewee.

For example, data segments belonging to Interviewee 163 (Søren) were mistakenly attributed to Interviewee 165 (Karina). This misattribution could have occurred due to the model identifying individual digits as separate tokens, allowing it to inadvertently select the wrong number.

> 22\. Difficulty in sticking to assigned roles in decentralized IT support (Interviewee 183)
>
> 34\. Difficulty in sticking to assigned roles in decentralized IT support (Interviewee 190)

This issue could be mitigated by using pseudonyms rather than numbers to identify interviewees or by choosing single-digit numbers to reduce the chance of error.

Furthermore,

Based on these findings, the accuracy of the generated output can be judged to be moderate to high.

### Relevance

Relevance refers to the degree of alignment between the model's output and the subject or context in question. In the case of the current analysis, relevance can be evaluated based on how accurately and appropriately the model grouped data segments under the right categories in the context of the IT investment process.

In some instances, the model made a significant departure from the real context, placing certain data segments under groups that were not directly related to the IT investment process. For instance, the model misclassified the data segment "Fear of data breaches and restrictions" and placed it under "Suggestions and Improvements for the IT Investment Process". While this segment is an important consideration for IT management, it is not a suggestion or improvement for the IT investment process per se.

Similarly, "Cost-saving attempts in decentralised IT support" was also placed under "Suggestions and Improvements for the IT Investment Process". This segments, while important in the broader context of IT management, do not directly pertain to the process of IT investment. Decentralised IT support is generally not involved in the central IT investment process, and while having a dedicated IT staff member is beneficial for a variety of reasons, it is not directly tied to the IT investment process.

These misclassifications indicate that the model seems to have made assumptions about the IT investment process without fully understanding the context in which the process operates. Instead of interpreting the data segments based on their inherent meaning, the model appears to be relying on superficial connections, possibly based on the co-occurrence of keywords.

This behaviour might indicate a gap in the model's understanding of the context. This is where a dialogue-based approach can potentially help. By allowing the researcher to interactively guide the model through the data analysis process, a dialogue-based approach can improve the model's understanding of the context, leading to a more relevant classification of data segments. The researcher can correct the model's misconceptions, clarify ambiguities, and provide additional contextual information to help the model make more accurate and relevant classifications.

### Completeness

Completeness refers to the representation of all data from the interviews in the affinity diagram. While the model demonstrated an extensive data segmentation process, certain context and subtext did not transition from the interviews into the notes. A dialogue approach could potentially bridge this gap, allowing for a deeper exploration of the underlying themes and complexities of the data.

### Clarity!!

Another aspect of accuracy is the correct classification of data segments into groups. However, similarly to the direct prompting approach, some segments were correctly identified but misplaced into unrelated groups. For example, data segments like "Fear of data breaches and restrictions", "Cost-saving attempts in decentralised IT support", and "Importance of having a dedicated IT staff member" were wrongly placed under "Suggestions and Improvements for the IT Investment Process", even though they were not related to the IT investment process in context.

Furthermore, the model placed a repeated data segment, "Need for more effective communication of the IT investment process", in two different groups: "Awareness and Understanding of the IT Investment Process" and "Challenges and Barriers in IT Investment Process". This redundancy indicates that the groups created might not be entirely distinct or meaningful.

Starting from the 25th data segment, the model displayed a tendency to duplicate previously identified data segments but with incorrect attributions to the interviewees. This behaviour might stem from the model's inherent capability for pattern recognition, causing it to persist with an established pattern even when it leads to errors. Additionally, this could be attributed to the demanding nature of the prompt, which required the generation of fifty data segments, presenting a challenging task for the model. Although the model fulfilled the explicit request, it overlooked the implicit requirement for the data segments to be distinct.

### Consistency and Clarity

Consistency and clarity in data grouping are vital for meaningful analysis. In this experiment, however, the model demonstrated a tendency to prematurely conclude the bicameral dialogue. This behaviour might stem from the patterns established earlier in the output. Consequently, the model's groupings were often not detailed enough to make meaningful connections in the data. Ideally, the two 'selves' in the bicameral dialogue would offer constructive critique of each other's ideas. However, instead of this ideal, they frequently gave noncritical feedback such as "good idea", indicating that the bicameral dialogue approach as it stands may provide more challenges than advantages.

In terms of clarity, the model's understanding of the context surrounding the IT investment process seemed limited. For instance, Group 3, "Challenges and Barriers in IT Investment Process", acted as a catch-all category, housing many data segments that could have been more evenly distributed with better context understanding. This is where a dialogue-based approach, involving the researcher conversing with the model, could be beneficial. The model could pose thought-provoking questions about the case, allowing the researcher to share the context intuitively, much like one would with a human researcher. This dialogue could potentially enable the model to make more meaningful connections in the data than what can be achieved by just inputting the raw data.

Further, modifying the prompt to make the model provide meaningful critiques of its decisions could potentially improve the consistency and clarity of the final outputted affinity diagram. Studies by @hebenstreit2023automatically and @shinn2023reflexion suggest that self-critique approaches are more fruitful if executed as separate requests to the API rather than included in a single extensive prompt. This could explain the lack of critical feedback in my experiments. It appears that the model, when given a new request, can get a fresh perspective, having its parameters cleared and reset. While anthropomorphising LLMs is generally not accurate, it seems that starting a new output sequence gives the model a refreshed "perspective" on the task.

### Interpretability

LLMs are often likened to "black boxes" due to the difficulty in understanding how they reach their conclusions. The reasoning typically occurs within the parameters behind the output, which isn't readily accessible. However, chain of thought approaches, like the one employed in this study, can enhance the model's performance on reasoning-based tasks and improve the interpretability of the output. It allows the researcher to follow the model's logic, checking it at every stage.

While the bicameral dialogue approach used in this study improved the interpretability of the output, it's unclear whether this method offers any advantages over a standard chain of logic approach, as featured in contemporary studies \[e.g., @hebenstreit2023automatically; @shinn2023reflexion\]. 

### Bias

The model's output did not appear to contain any bias. However, the premature termination of the bicameral dialogues in the think sections could potentially introduce bias in the output. A dialogue approach could help mitigate this bias.

### Utility

The output of the model should provide actionable insights. While the model segmented the data extensively, it did not delve into the potential implications of the identified themes and issues. An explicit description of the IT investment process, coupled with a dialogue-based approach for a deeper exploration of the data, could help enhance the utility of the model's output.



## Opportunities for future research
### A more extensive investigation of practice in other municipalities
In the current study, the primary focus was on investigating practices within Vejle municipality, with only a few observations made about how other municipalities handled new IT investments. Future research should take a closer look at the practices in other municipalities and assess their effectiveness to attempt to understand what the best practice is within municipalities in the present day. To a certain extent, it could also be helpful to examine the private sector's practices. Although the public sector is fundamentally different from the private sector, IT departments in medium and large private sector companies might face similar challenges to the IT department in Vejle, making it worth investigating.

To explore other municipalities, it would be beneficial to utilise existing connections between Vejle and other municipalities, for example, Aarhus, Odense, Fredericia, Sønderborg, and others.

### A closer look into the IT investment process with a focus on managerial science
Although the current research employs an ethnographic methodology to explore the challenges associated with the IT investment process, primarily from a user perspective, integrating insights from experts in communication and managerial science may prove invaluable for developing tailored communication strategies and action plans.

By incorporating principles from managerial science, researchers could systematically examine the decision-making processes, resource allocation, and performance measurements affecting the IT investment process at Vejle Municipality. This approach can help identify inefficiencies, misaligned incentives, and other potential barriers to effective IT investment management.

Moreover, communication specialists can contribute to the development of targeted communication plans, providing guidance on the most effective methods to convey information, promote collaboration, and foster a culture of transparency and accountability. These experts can also identify potential communication gaps and recommend strategies to bridge them, ensuring that all stakeholders understand their roles, responsibilities, and the overall goals of the IT investment process.

Additionally, an interdisciplinary approach that combines these ethnographic findings with insights from managerial science and communication expertise can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the problems facing the IT investment process. This holistic perspective can facilitate the identification of key factors influencing employee behaviour and organisational culture, thereby enabling the development of evidence-based interventions to improve the IT investment process within the municipality.
### Alternative prompting approaches for GPT-based affinity diagrams
This study identified a significant challenge, which hindered further prompt iteration and refinement of the model's output, specifically the escalating token cost. The more tokens the model is prompted with, the higher the cost for executing the request. Submitting a prompt containing the entire interview data already utilizes a substantial number of tokens. Including both the interview data and the affinity diagram generated by the model in a new request would further increase the expense. While these costs might be negligible in certain contexts, they can rapidly escalate to become a considerable financial burden for small-budget projects, such as a master's thesis that is self-funded by the researcher.

Given these considerations, future research could explore alternative ways to structure and sequence prompts for GPT-based affinity diagrams. As indicated by @hebenstreit2023automatically and @shinn2023reflexion, dividing the prompt into smaller segments and inputting them sequentially might prove to be a more effective strategy for achieving better results. This approach could potentially mitigate the model's performance degradation when it is faced with an excessive number of tasks, thereby improving the overall quality of the output.
